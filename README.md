# Natural Language Processing and Topic Modeling on Interview data
The ROSSEY project continues to conduct interviews to learn how to make schools safer for students and their families and to understand the opinions of people living in rural agricultural areas about COVID-19.

This is a part of the code for the unsupervised learning project that clusters interview responses into groups, visualizes the results, and identifies their latent topics/structures.

## Steps
- Preprocessing review text by tokenization, stemming, removing stop words and extracted features by Term Frequency - Inverse Document Frequency(TF-IDF).
- Training unsupervised learning models of K-means clustering and Latent Dirichlet Analysis.
- Identifying latent topic and keywords of each review for clustering.
